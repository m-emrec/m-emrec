### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a junior Flutter developer with over two years of experience. I have a strong algorithmic intelligence, I pick things up quickly, and I'm excellent at solving problems. I prioritize producing clean code and adhering to SOLID principles. I am experienced in state management using Bloc and Provider and am eager to take on new challenges and contribute effectively to any project.
